"""PolySolver: decides  P and R and Defs |= (q = 0)  over F_p. Sound, incomplete.

- P: premises, polynomials each read as "= 0".
- R: ranges lo <= x <= hi on the integer representative of a variable.
- Defs: definitions for variables that are not declared.
- Solved: equations x = t for declared x, each checked when added (add_solved).

The answer is ``Implied`` (with a reason) or ``Unknown``. There is no
"not implied": Unknown only means no rule applied.

Solved equations. A premise is trusted; a solved equation is not: add_solved
first checks that x = t follows from what is already known, exactly as a
query would be checked. Only then is x replaced by t, in the premises (as
the rules see them) and in every later query. The caller picks which
equations to try and in what order (e.g. the substitutions powdr recorded);
the solver only checks them. Defs differ: they name fresh variables, so they
need no check, and no premise can mention them.

The one kind of equation the solver finds by itself is a constant: a premise
that, under the solved equations, mentions one variable linearly pins it.
solve_constants adds all of them, propagating, when the caller asks.

Rules, cheapest first:
- N (normalize): q has the same zero key as one premise.
- S (no-wrap split): a premise G * (c1*a1 + ... + cn*an) with ranged a_i whose
  weighted sum cannot wrap past p implies G * a_j = 0 for every j.

The solver knows nothing about circuits: only variables, polynomials,
ranges and definitions.
