"""Polynomials over F_p and the zero key.

A polynomial is a dict ``{monomial: coeff}``. A monomial is a tuple of
``(Var, exponent)`` pairs sorted by Var; ``()`` is the constant monomial.
Coefficients live in ``[1, p)``; zero terms are dropped.

The zero key makes a polynomial monic, so two polynomials with the same key
differ by a nonzero constant factor and have the same zeros.
