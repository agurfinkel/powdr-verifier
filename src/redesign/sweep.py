"""Step B: one obligation per candidate constraint or stateless interaction.

For a candidate constraint c the obligation is c[w]: it must follow from the
reference side's constraints and byte ranges. The rungs, cheapest first:

  trivial    - c[w] is identically zero (canonical key is empty)
  identical  - c[w] has the same canonical key as a reference constraint
  normalize / nowrap-split - PolySolver proves it
  undecided  - nothing applied; left for the SMT rungs (not built yet)

A stateless bus interaction (a lookup) is the fact "mult != 0 => args in
table", where the table is an uninterpreted predicate. Its obligation I[w]:

  trivial    - mult[w] is zero, so the lookup asserts nothing
  identical  - the reference has an interaction with the same bus, mult and
               args (lens's _bus_exact_key), so it already asserts this fact
  evaluated  - every argument is a constant (under the mapping and the solved
               equations) and the tuple is a table row (tables.is_row); the
               only rung that uses what a table contains. PcLookup is not
               evaluated (not trusted)
  congruence - a reference interaction J on the same bus with PolySolver
               proving mult_I = mult_J and arg_I,k = arg_J,k for every k: by
               congruence, J's fact gives I's. J is proposed by an index on
               PolySolver's normal forms (untrusted search); only the
               implies_equal verdicts decide

Results are cached by canonical key. A direction is verified only if no
obligation is undecided. Stateful buses (memory, execution bridge) are not
checked yet, so "verified" is not yet "equivalent".
