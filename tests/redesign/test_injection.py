"""Hand-made bug injections on the is-zero step keccak 2106332 008 -> 009.

Each test breaks one thing in a copy of the dumps (in memory; the files are
never touched) and checks that the redesign does not pass the broken step.
Without SMT rungs nothing can produce a counterexample yet, so "caught"
means "not verified", with the undecided obligations pointing at the edit.

Constraint numbers, from ``redesign check keccak 2106332 008 009 -v``:
  After  (009): c14 = (1 - cmp) * sum a,  c15 = f * sum a - cmp,  c0..c13 kept
  Before (008): c9..c12 = (1 - cmp) * a_i,  c13 = sum a_i * inv_i - cmp
